<ul><b>Assumption of Risk</b>
</ul>

<ul>1. The client/owner recognizes that employees from Pet Sitters are not veterinarians and cannot be held responsible for the detection or diagnosis of diseases or illnesses that could arise during Pet Sitter's stay.
</ul>
                
<ul> 2. While Pet Sitters acts with diligence and professionalism in bestowing services to pets under its care, Pet Sitters cannot prevent all accidents or injuries that might occur 
during the course of a normal stay or during periods of group playtime activities.
</ul>				

<ul> 3. As such, by handing over custody of his or her pet to Pet Sitters, the client/owner retains responsibility for any risk of disease or injury that might be sustained by his or her pet. 
The owner also assumes liability for any material damage or injuries to other animals if caused by his or her pet.
